# MinoTaurus
A scheduling and evaluation framework for performance test tools. It will mainly focus on executing JMeter performance tests but will be extended later to include things like Grinder.


The ideas here are:

1) Scheduled test executions

2) Perm or Cloud execution (RackSpace, AWS,...)

3) Evaluation of results

4) Comparison of tests

5) Manage data used by tests during execution 


This product has been used for nearly 10y now. The attempt here is to abstract it to a level that it works as OSS i.e. in a generalised environment. It will always need customisation and adhere to minimal scripting rules.
